  // `require` some other files, etc. Webpack pulls these all into a modularized

    // be used by any lazy-loading in your Webpack scripts to load more chunks
    // from the server. Basically, `path` sets where in your project's file structure
    // your bundle will be written, while `publicPath` tells your Webpack modules
    // where your bundle can be requested from the server. In this repo, `publicPath`
    // tells the webpack-dev-server that it's ok to serve the files in the dist folder.

    // `loaders` lets you plug in programs that will transform your source files
    // when Webpack loads them with a `require` statement. A lot of the magic of
    // Webpack is done using loaders. In this example, there's one loader declared
    // to use Babel to transform ES6 and JSX into ES5.

        // as its terminating characters, this loader will be applied.
        test: /\.jsx?$/,

        // `exclude` lets you specify tests that, when passed by a filename, cause those
        // files to *not* be transformed by the loader. There's also an `include` option
        // that works in the inverse way.
        exclude: /node_modules/,

        // `loader` names the actual loader that is to be applied. In this case,
        // this object requires 'babel-loader' to do the transformation.
        // We could actually apply multiple loaders here by using the property `loaders`
        // instead of `loader`, which takes an array of loader names.
        // 
        // When you're declaring loaders in this field, you can leave off the `-loader` part
        // of the package name. Webpack will interpret `babel` as `babel-loader` here,
        // `coffee` as `coffee-loader`, etc. But you can also just write out `babel-loader`,
        // if you prefer.
        loader: 'babel',

        // `query` lets you pass options to the loader's process. The options that a loader takes
        // are specific to each loader. In this case, `babel-loader` is being told to use the 'react'
        // and 'es2015' presets when it transforms files. `query` becomes a query string, similar
        // to what you see in request URLs, and the same thing could be achieved by writing this above:
        // loader: 'babel?presets[]=react,presets[]=es2015'
        query: {
          presets: ['react', 'es2015'],
        }
