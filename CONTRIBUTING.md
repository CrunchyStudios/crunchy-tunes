# Contributing

## General Workflow

1. Fork the repo
1. Pull latest upstream changes from master
1. Cut a namespaced feature branch from master
  - bug/...
  - feat/...
  - test/...
  - doc/...
  - refactor/...
1. Make commits to your feature branch. Prefix each commit like so:
  - (fix) [Fixes/Closes/Resolves] #[Issue Number] -
  - (feat) Add a new feature
  - (refactor) ...
  - (cleanup) ...
  - (test) ...
  - (doc) ...
1. When you've finished with your fix or feature, Rebase upstream changes into your branch. submit a [pull request][]
   directly to master. Include a description of your changes, and noting which task it completes in waffle.io (e.g. Closes #2 - Completes contributing.md).
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by another maintainer. The point of code
   reviews is to help keep the codebase clean and of high quality and, equally
   as important, to help you grow as a programmer. If your code reviewer
   requests you make a change you don't understand, ask them why.
1. Fix any issues raised by your code reviwer, and push your fixes as a single
   new commit.
1. Once the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged by another member of the team. Do not merge your own commits.

## Detailed Workflow

### Fork the repo

Use github’s interface to make a fork of the repo, clone it to your local machine, then add that repo as an upstream remote:

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOURG_GITHUB_NAME>/<NAME_OF_REPO>.git
cd <NAME_OF_REPO>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackreactor-labs/<NAME_OF_REPO>.git
```

Make sure your have the latest changes from upstream master in your local master branch.
```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

### Cut a namespaced feature branch from master

Your branch should follow this naming convention:
  - bug/...
  - feat/...
  - test/...
  - doc/...
  - refactor/...

These commands will help you do this:

``` bash

# Creates your branch and brings you there
git checkout -b `your-branch-name`
```

### Make commits to your feature branch. 

Prefix each commit like so
  - (feat) Added a new feature
  - (fix) Fixed inconsistent tests [Fixes #0]
  - (refactor) ...
  - (cleanup) ...
  - (test) ...
  - (doc) ...

Make changes and commits on your branch, and make sure that you
only make changes that are relevant to this branch. If you find
yourself making unrelated changes, make a new branch for those
changes.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Commit messages should be written in the present tense; e.g. "Fix continuous
  integration script".
- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the
  commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max. Remember: This is a summary,
  not a detailed description of everything that changed.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should
  be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be
  as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.

### Rebase upstream changes into your branch

Once you are done making changes, you can begin the process of getting
your code merged into the main repo. Step 1 is to rebase upstream
changes to the master branch into yours by running this command
from your branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

This will start the rebase process. You must commit all of your changes
before doing this. If there are no conflicts, this should just roll all
of your changes back on top of the changes from upstream, leading to a
nice, clean, linear commit history.

If there are conflicting changes, git will start yelling at you part way
through the rebasing process. Git will pause rebasing to allow you to sort
out the conflicts. You do this the same way you solve merge conflicts,
by checking all of the files git says have been changed in both histories
and picking the versions you want. Be aware that these changes will show
up in your pull request, so try and incorporate upstream changes as much
as possible.

You pick a file by `git add`ing it - you do not make commits during a
rebase.

Once you are done fixing conflicts for a specific commit, run:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

This will continue the rebasing process. Once you are done fixing all
conflicts you should run the existing tests to make sure you didn’t break
anything, then run your new tests (there are new tests, right?) and
make sure they work also.

If rebasing broke anything, fix it, then repeat the above process until
you get here again and nothing is broken and all the tests pass.

### Make a pull request

Push the changes on your local feature branch to a new branch on your fork:
`git push -u origin <feature_branch_name>`

Make a clear pull request from your fork and branch to the upstream master
branch, detailing exactly what changes you made and what feature this
should add. Also, if part of the original contributing team, include which waffle.io task this pull request maps to (e.g. Closes #2 -  Completes contributing.md).  The clearer your pull request is the faster you can get
your changes incorporated into this repo.

At least one other person MUST give your changes a code review, and once
they are satisfied they will merge your changes into upstream. Alternatively,
they may have some requested changes. You should make more commits to your
branch to fix these, then follow this process again from rebasing onwards.

Once you get back here, make a comment requesting further review and
someone will look at your code again. If they like it, it will get merged,
else, just repeat again.

Thanks for contributing!

### Merging a pull request

Only merge a pull request after it has been reviewed during team code reviews. DO NOT merge your own pull request... EVER. Check that a pull request complies with all the guidelines above before merging. 

GitHub by default merges pull request using the --no-ff option (no fast forward merge), which created superfluous merge commits in the repo history. This is not desirable.

Instead use the following manual instructions to merge a pull request (assumes that the main repo is added to your local repo as a remote called 'upstream'):

```bash
git checkout -b [contributors_username]-[pull_request_branch_name]
git pull [contributors_fork_url] [pull_request_branch_name]

git checkout master
git pull --rebase upstream master
git merge [contributors_username]-[pull_request_branch_name]
```
If you get merge conflicts at this point, abort the process and tell the contributor to update their pull request by using 'git pull --rebase upstream master' into their feature branch, resolving conflicts, and pushing their changes to update their pull request.

If the merge succeeds without conflicts, finish merging the pull request by typing `git push upstream master`

### Guidelines

1. Uphold the current code standard:
    - Keep your code [DRY][].
    - Apply the [boy scout rule][].
    - Follow [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
1. Run the [tests][] before submitting a pull request.
1. Tests are very, very important. Submit tests if your pull request contains
   new, testable behavior.
1. Your pull request is comprised of a single ([squashed][]) commit.

## Checklist:

This is just to help you organize your process

- [ ] Did I cut my work branch off of master (don't cut new branches from existing feature brances)?
- [ ] Did I follow the correct naming convention for my branch?
- [ ] Is my branch focused on a single main change?
 - [ ] Do all of my changes directly relate to this change?
- [ ] Did I rebase the upstream master branch after I finished all my
  work?
- [ ] Did I write a clear pull request message detailing what changes I made?
- [ ] Did I get a team code review?
 - [ ] Did I make any requested changes from that code review?

If you follow all of these guidelines and make good changes, you should have
no problem getting your changes merged in.
